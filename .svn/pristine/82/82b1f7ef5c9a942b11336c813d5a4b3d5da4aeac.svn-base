		<p>This is the Syntax Coloring page of the Brainchild configuration program. With it 
			you can change several syntax coloring settings and options of the Brainchild 
			control. The various settings are explaned below:</p>
		<table cellSpacing="0" cellPadding="2" width="100%" border="1">
			<TR>
				<TD width="35%">Enable syntax coloring</TD>
				<TD width="65%">This option allows you to turn on or off the syntax coloring for this 
					text class. For the syntax coloring to work the syntax coloring option on the <A href="general.htm">
						general page</A> must be turned on.</TD>
			</TR>
			<tr>
				<td width="35%">Blocks</td>
				<td width="65%">These controls allow you to add and or edit text block. You see a 
					toolbar with four buttons, <IMG alt="" src="NewTB.gif">, <IMG alt="" src="DelTB.gif">,&nbsp;<IMG alt="" src="UpTB.gif">
					and <IMG alt="" src="DownTB.gif">.&nbsp;
					<p>&nbsp;<IMG alt="" src="NewTB.gif">adds a new block,&nbsp;<IMG alt="" src="DelTB.gif">
						removes the selected block. With the&nbsp;<IMG alt="" src="UpTB.gif"> and&nbsp;<IMG alt="" src="DownTB.gif">
						buttons you can change the position of the blocks in the list.</p>
					<p>To edit the entries in the block list you simply double-click the desired entry. 
						This will open the&nbsp;<A href="block_edit.htm">block editor dialog</A> which 
						allows you to edit the selected entry.</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="35%">Escape character</td>
				<td width="65%">Here you can type the character which escapes a block terminator. This 
					means that the block will continue after the block terminator is seen. For 
					example a string in C:
					<p>"This is a \"string\""</p>
					<p>When you set the escape character to \ the second and third double quote will not be 
						seen as the block terminator since they are preceeded by the escape character.</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="35%">Common&nbsp;colors</td>
				<td width="65%">This lists the general colors which can be changed. When you select one 
					of the entries the color button, <IMG alt="" src="ColorTB.gif">, on the toolbar 
					is enabled and you can click it to <A href="ColorSel.htm">edit the color</A> for 
					the selected entry.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="35%">Font</td>

					to select the font used by this text class. You can only select fixed width 
					fonts.</td>
