		<p>This is the Files page of the Brainchild configuration program. With it you can 
			change the default file mode and file backup options. The various settings are 
			explaned below:</p>
		<table border="1" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellPadding="2">
			<tr>
				<td width="35%">Default file mode</td>
				<td width="65%">Here you can choose the default file mode. There are three options:
					<ol>
						<li>
							<b>MS DOS</b>
						- Terminates lines with a carriage return and a line feed.
						<li>
							<b>Macintosh</b>
						- Terminates lines with a carriage return.
						<li>
							<b>Unix</b> - Terminates lines with a line feed.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>The mode you select here is only for the files created by Brainchild. When you load 
						a file from disk it's mode will automatically be used to save it also.</p>
