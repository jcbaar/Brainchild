		<p>Have you ever created a program which required text-editing capabilities? I am sure 
			you found that the standard Windows edit control was not the most flexible 
			editing solution you can imagine. There is the Windows RichEdit control but 
			this also does not offer the easiest way to include powerful editing 
			capabilities to your applications.</p>
		<p>This does not have to be a problem anymore. With Brainchild you have powerful and 
			modern editing capabilities with only a few lines of code. Features of the 
			Brainchild edit control include:</p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>
			Settings are text class based. The user can create his or her own text classes. 
			The default settings files included with the Brainchild package include some 
			good examples.
			<li>
			Control panel based settings program included.
			<li>
			Fully customizable syntax coloring for both on screen and printer outputs.
			<li>
			Multi-level Undo/Redo. The maximum number of hops is settable.
			<li>
			File size only limited by the amount of available memory.
			<li>
			Bookmarks. The user can create as many bookmarks as there are lines in the 
			text.
			<li>
			Fully customizable keyboard. The user can map any number of commands to a 
			single key combination.
			<li>
