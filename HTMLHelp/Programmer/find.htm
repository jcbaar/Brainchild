		<p>This is the find dialog. With it you can search for each occurence of a combination 
			of characters. In the dialog as displayed above you have the following 
			possibilities:</p>
		<table border="1" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellPadding="2" ID="Table1">
			<tr>
				<td width="35%">Find what</td>
				<td width="65%">
					<P>This combo-box control contains a small history of character strings you have 
						searched for. You can either select one of these strings or type in a new one.
					</P>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="35%">
					Match whole words only</td>
				<td width="65%">
					When this option is checked you look for whole words only. This means that when 
					you look for the word "hello" you will find it in text like "hello world" but 
					not in text like "hello-world".</td>
