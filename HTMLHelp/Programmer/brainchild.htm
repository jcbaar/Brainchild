			Brainchild is a custom editor control which allows programmers to include 
			powerful and modern editing capabilities to their own applications. The 
			brainchild editor control has many features you would expect from a modern 
			editor.

			<p>
				I started brainchild back in 1993 on the Amiga computer. For a couple of years 
				I used it as the editor for all my projects on that machine without ever 
				releasing it to the general public. When the Amiga was all but dead and I 
				switched to the Windows platform I really missed my old editor so I started 
				porting my old code to the Windows&nbsp;OS. Since I used Visual C++ 6.0 I kind 
				of gotten used to the editor this IDE offered so it is no surprise that the 
				current Brainchild version is modelled after the VC++ 6.0 editor.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first windows running Brainchild was not a custom control. It was a simple 
				SDI application which was a simple port of the Amiga version. Problem was that 
				the old Amiga code was very outdated. It did not have&nbsp;multi-level 
				undo/redo, line length was limited to 1000 bytes and it did not use syntax 
				coloring. In short it was not of this day and age. After having looked at about 
				all the editor source-code on the Web I stumbled accross the <font color="#000000">CrystalEdit 
					MFC</font> components written by Andrei <font color="#000000">Stcherbatchenko</font>
				<font color="#000000">. These components had&nbsp;two features which were at the top of 
					my list:</font>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Multi-level undo/redo.
				<li>
					Syntax coloring.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				I have used his code to base the undo/redo of the Brainchild control on. I have 
				written my own version of syntax coloring since I wanted to make it 
				customizable for the end user. The <font color="#000000">CrystalEdit&nbsp;</font>components 
				only understood C/C++ code. With the Brainchild control you can add text 
				classes which have fully configurable syntax-coloring.
